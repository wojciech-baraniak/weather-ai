# weather-ai
python project using tensor flow and jupyter that "predicts" weather  
whole code could be more efficient, 2 files that are used for generating output could be easly made into one bigger, some parts of the code are also unused, but because the fact that the code worked fine when I tried it, I decided not to change it.
